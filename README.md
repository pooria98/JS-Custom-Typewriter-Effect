# JS-Custom-Typewriter-Effect

Custom typewriter effect made with vanilla Javascript.  
This script goes through an array of words and prints each one letter by letter on the screen.  
after reaching the end of the array, it shuffles the array and starts again from the beginning.  
there's also a condition which prevents the first element of the suffled array to be the same as the last element before shuffle.
